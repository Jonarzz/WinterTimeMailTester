# Winter Time Mail Tester
Python script that should send mails during changing to winter time which will allow to check how different mail hosts deal with the change.

# The result of the experiment
I tested the most popular mail servers in my country: Gmail, WP, Onet and o2. There were two possibilities: 
* mails are not sorted by date and the mail that got there later will show up with earlier hour
* mails are sorted by date, so they are not in order of time they were sent

The first case applies to Gmail, WP and o2, while the second one applies to Onet.
